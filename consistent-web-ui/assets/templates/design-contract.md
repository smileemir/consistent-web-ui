# Design contract - {product}

> Save this file in the project (for example `docs/design-contract.md`) so every future AI or human session builds on the same decisions. Change it only through an approved decision; record the date. Each decision has an ID that pages and reviews can cite.

**Version** {n} · **Approved by** {owner} · **Date** {date} · **Theme source** `{path}`

| --- | --- | --- |
| DC-30 | Motion roles | instant {ms}, quick {ms}, panel {ms}, story {ms}; easing |
| DC-31 | Motion policy | floor: brief feedback on every change the user causes; ceiling: nothing moves on its own except real progress and at most one attention moment per view; one-shot over loops; reduced motion = final state |

| DC-36 | Info (i) help | only where purpose or effect cannot be inferred and a wrong guess costs; text = purpose or effect in at most two sentences; at most one per card; component {project popover / `info-toggletip.html`} |
